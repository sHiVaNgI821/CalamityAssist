        "    \"Earthquake: Caused by the sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, usually due to tectonic plate movements. This can occur along fault lines or boundaries where the plates collide, slide past each other, or separate.\",\n",
        "    \"Tsunami: Generated by underwater disturbances such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. These disturbances displace large volumes of water, creating powerful ocean waves that can travel long distances.\",\n",
        "    \"Volcanic Eruption: Triggered by the rise of molten rock (magma) from deep within the Earth's mantle. When the pressure becomes too great, the magma is expelled through a volcano, releasing gases, ash, and lava onto the surface.\",\n",
        "    \"Hurricane: Formed over warm ocean waters when a combination of low atmospheric pressure, high humidity, and wind patterns create a spinning storm system. The warm ocean water provides the energy source for the hurricane to intensify.\",\n",
        "    \"Tornado: Created by the collision of warm, moist air from the south and cold, dry air from the north. Atmospheric instability, temperature contrasts, and wind shear cause the air to rotate vertically, forming a destructive funnel-shaped cloud.\",\n",
        "    \"Flood: Caused by excessive rainfall, rapid snowmelt, or the failure of dams or levees. When the amount of water exceeds the capacity of rivers, lakes, or drainage systems, it overflows and inundates surrounding areas.\",\n",
        "    \"Drought: Occurs when there is an extended period of significantly below-average precipitation leading to a lack of water supply. High temperatures and evaporation rates exacerbate the drying of soil and vegetation.\",\n",
        "    \"Wildfire: Ignited by a combination of dry and hot weather, lightning strikes, or human activities such as campfires or careless burning. Once ignited, wildfires spread rapidly, fueled by dry vegetation and driven by wind.\",\n",
        "    \"Blizzard: Characterized by strong winds, blowing snow, and freezing temperatures. Blizzards typically occur during winter storms when there is abundant moisture in the air and a strong low-pressure system.\",\n",
        "    \"Landslide: Caused by heavy rainfall saturating the ground, earthquake activity destabilizing slopes, or human activities altering the natural landscape. The gravitational force pulls loose soil and rock downslope, often triggered by a specific event.\",\n",
        "    \"Avalanche: Occurs when a mass of snow rapidly slides down a mountainside. Factors that contribute to avalanches include heavy snowfall, steep slopes, changes in temperature, or human activity like skiing or snowmobiling.\",\n",
        "    \"Cyclone: Similar to hurricanes, cyclones are large-scale rotating storm systems. They form over warm ocean waters and are characterized by low atmospheric pressure, high humidity, and distinct wind patterns.\",\n",
        "    \"Heatwave: A prolonged period of excessively hot weather caused by high-pressure systems that trap warm air in a region. Heatwaves are often intensified by human-induced climate change.\",\n",
        "    \"Hailstorm: Generated by updrafts in thunderstorms, where raindrops are lifted to higher altitudes within the storm cloud and freeze into ice pellets. Hailstones grow in size as they are repeatedly carried by updrafts and downdrafts.\",\n",
        "    \"Dust Storm: Occurs when strong winds lift and carry large amounts of dry soil or sand particles. Dust storms often happen in arid or semi-arid regions where loose soil and dry weather conditions are prevalent.\",\n",
        "    \"Sinkhole: Formed when the ground collapses due to the dissolution of underground limestone or other soluble rocks. This can be a natural process over long periods or can be triggered by human activities like mining or excessive groundwater pumping.\",\n",
        "    \"Famine: Caused by a combination of factors, including crop failure due to drought, floods, pests, or diseases, as well as socioeconomic issues, conflict, and lack of access to food and resources.\",\n",
        "    \"Epidemic: Refers to the rapid spread of infectious diseases among a large number of people in a specific population or region. Epidemics can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or other pathogens transmitted through various means.\",\n",
        "    \"Frost: Occurs when temperatures drop below freezing point, causing the water vapor in the air to condense and freeze on surfaces. Frost can damage crops, plants, and exposed materials.\",\n",
        "    \"Mudslide: Triggered by heavy rainfall saturating slopes with loose soil or rock. The excess water increases the weight and reduces the friction between particles, causing them to slide downhill.\",\n",
        "    \"Ice Storm: Results from freezing rain, which occurs when raindrops fall through a layer of subfreezing air near the surface. The raindrops freeze upon contact with cold surfaces, including trees, power lines, and roads.\",\n",
        "    \"Solar Flare: Eruptions on the sun's surface that release a massive amount of energy, including electromagnetic radiation, high-energy particles, and solar plasma. When directed towards Earth, solar flares can disrupt communication systems and affect the planet's magnetic field.\",\n",
        "    \"Tidal Wave: Created by strong ocean currents or undersea volcanic eruptions. Tidal waves, also known as tidal surges or storm surges, are characterized by rapidly rising sea levels and can cause significant coastal flooding.\",\n",
        "    \"Heat Exhaustion: Occurs when the body overheats due to prolonged exposure to high temperatures and inadequate fluid intake. It is often associated with physical exertion and can lead to dehydration and other health complications.\",\n",
